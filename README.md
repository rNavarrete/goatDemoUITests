Demo of XCUITests for the Goat sneaker app

This is a demo for a log in and log out UI automated smoke test for Goat using XCUITest.
To run the test you would need to have a valid email/password for Goat. You have to run the test on a real device with Goat app already installed and in a clean state: meaning no previously logged in users.
This is a simple demo showing how a login test could work.
